# ArtistSearch
A simple project that uses Retrofit and RxJava to fetch data from the Last FM api.

The initial commit is just a app that fetches data from the Last Fm Api using Retrofit, RxJava and
RxObservables.
It shows two main ways to do this, either using a single subscription(Main Activity) or a composite
subscription(SimilarArtistsActivity).

It also has examples of how to make an object parcelable, custom floating action button behaviour,
progress bar on top of a fab and in the toolbar, simple image loading with Picasso, adding a
fragment to an activity dynamically, fragment replacement, recycler view use e.t.c

This was just my practise but I hope t helps someone out there. :D
